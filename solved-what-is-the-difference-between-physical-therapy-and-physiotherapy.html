This means that most people don't know the difference between the two. Many countries use physiotherapy to refer to the practice. However, in the United States, physical therapy is the dominant term and physiotherapy can either describe physical therapy or be used to describe a therapy with little difference to physical therapy. There is very little difference in physical therapy and physiotherapy.</p><p>Even so, a small, but notable difference between physical therapy and physiotherapy could be claimed. Some health care workers believe that physiotherapy can be described as a hands-on method of rehabilitation therapy. The physiotherapist employs manual techniques to assist the patient. It could also include deepening your stretches or other methods. Others would argue that physical therapy can be viewed as primarily an exercise-based treatment. There are numerous benefits to physical therapy, regardless of any disagreements.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 24, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/authors/therapist/" rel="author">Therapist</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/what-is-physiotherapy.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What is Physiotherapy?</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-24T20:27" class="feed__date">June 24, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/what-is-physiotherapy.html">What is Physiotherapy?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-24T20:26" class="feed__date">June 24, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/physiotherapy-has-many-health-benefits.html">Physiotherapy has many health benefits</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-24T20:25" class="feed__date">June 24, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/there-are-4-types-of-physiotherapy-you-should-be-aware.html">There are 4 types of physiotherapy you should be aware</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Physiotherapy Ottawa</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/PhysiotherapyOttawa/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
