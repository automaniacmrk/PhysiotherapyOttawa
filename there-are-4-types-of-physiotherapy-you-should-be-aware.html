He may recommend stretching and strengthening exercises, massage therapy, or mobility aids that speed up healing.</p><p>Sports therapists also conduct tests to assess your fitness level and identify your weak areas. They can also prescribe exercises for people with tendonitis, muscle imbalances, shin-splints or back pain. You will be able to perform better and decrease your risk of injury.</p><p>Are you suffering from back or neck pain? Have you suffered muscle strains and injuries, such as fractures, muscle strains or sprains. Orthopedic physiotherapy can help with these issues. A skilled therapist will diagnose, manage and treat musculoskeletal disorders that affect your flexibility and range of motion.</p><p>The treatment usually involves some combination of massages, balance and stretching, cryotherapy and heat therapy or spinal manipulation. Physiotherapists can also recommend at-home exercises and ergonomic devices that speed up healing.</p><p>Find a physiotherapist that specializes in your problem.
