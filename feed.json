They will create exercises that contract, relax and improve mobility for injured or injured body parts, depending on their needs. The goal of these exercises is usually to get back common movements that are painful or impossible to perform. Patients can usually perform the exercises at home once they are comfortable with them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes physical therapists may use additional equipment or methods in order to treat patients. Cold and hot therapies such as ice, cold packs, or infrared heating, are available to relieve pain and treat chronic conditions. Because it uses deep heat to decrease inflammation, ultrasound is a common treatment.</p>\n<p>Physical therapists who treat acute and chronic pain with TENS units also use them. An electrode is placed near the area of pain with a TENS device. The nerve fibers then send signals to the brain in an attempt to block pain signals.</p>\n<h2>Pain Relief Treatments</h2>\n<p>While meds will be helpful, a physiotherapist may also recommend other pain relief methods that can work in conjunction with your medication. You'll be able to continue with some of these treatments yourself between appointments - for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ice packs to soothe hot, swollen joints</li>\n<li>heat packs to relax tense, tired muscles</li>\n<li>splints to support swollen or painful joints</li>\n<li>TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), which works by altering pain messages to your brain. A TENS machine is a small electronic device that sends pulses to the nerve endings via pads placed on your skin. Many people find this soothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some physiotherapists may have had additional training in other pain relief techniques, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>massage or manipulation to reduce stiffness and pain, relax muscles and help to improve the range of movement in a joint</li>\n<li>Acupuncture is believed to be effective by blocking pain signals from the brain, releasing natural painkillers known as endorphins and thus causing acupuncture to take effect.</li>\n<li>electrotherapy, where techniques such as ultrasound and low-level laser therapy can help to stimulate the healing process and therefore reduce pain</li>\n<li>Steroid injections may be an option if your joint is particularly sensitive or making it hard to move.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more about managing your pain.</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.newvictoria.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/banner/Header-2000x600px-Treatments-clinics-gp-and-physiotherapy-physiotherapy-.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Physiotherapy\" width=\"80%\" height=\"auto\"></h2>\n<h2>Role of the physiotherapist</h2>\n<p>A physiotherapist's role is diverse and not always the same over two days.
